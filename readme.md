An implementation of deterministic annealing for clustering. My goal is to understand phase transitions in clustering, while annealing. My broader motivation is to understand this as an application of the [Information Bottleneck principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_bottleneck_method) and [renormalization group flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization_group), and the [implications for deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02406).
